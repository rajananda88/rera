			    <div class="border"><div class="orange"></div><div class="black"></div></div>
				<p>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation is the apex authority of Government of India at the national level to formulate policies, sponsor and support programme, coordinate the activities of various Central Ministries, State Governments and other nodal authorities and monitor the programmes concerning all the issues of urban employment, poverty and housing in the country.<br>
<br>


To aim at protecting the rights and interests of consumers and promotion of uniformity and standardization of business practices and transactions in the real estate sector, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation had formulated Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, 2016. It attempted to balance the interests of consumers and promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It also sought to establish symmetry of information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum standards of accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism.<br><br>



Under this Act, it is stipulated that all State/UTs would have their own Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and dedicated website for their respective RERAs. This Act makes it mandatory for all commercial and residential real estate projects to register with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority for launching a project, in order to provide greater transparency in project-marketing and execution. On successful registration, the promoter of the project will be provided with a registration number, a login id and password for the applicants to fill up essential details on the aforementioned website of the RERA. Real estate agents who facilitate selling or purchase of properties must take prior registration from RERA. Such agents will be issued a single registration number for each State or Union Territory, which must be quoted by the agent in every sale facilitated.
