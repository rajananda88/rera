				<h1 class="mar_top8">About Real Estate Act, 2016 </h1>
			    <div class="border"><div class="orange"></div><div class="black"></div></div>
				<p>The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation is the apex authority of Government of India at the national level to formulate policies, sponsor and support programme, coordinate the activities of various Central Ministries, State Governments and other nodal authorities and monitor the programmes concerning all the issues of urban employment, poverty and housing in the country.<br>
<br>


To aim at protecting the rights and interests of consumers and promotion of uniformity and standardization of business practices and transactions in the real estate sector, Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation had formulated Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Bill, 2016. It attempted to balance the interests of consumers and promoters by imposing certain responsibilities on both. It also sought to establish symmetry of information between the promoter and purchaser, transparency of contractual conditions, set minimum standards of accountability and a fast-track dispute resolution mechanism.<br><br>



Under this Act, it is stipulated that all State/UTs would have their own Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) and dedicated website for their respective RERAs. This Act makes it mandatory for all commercial and residential real estate projects to register with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority for launching a project, in order to provide greater transparency in project-marketing and execution. On successful registration, the promoter of the project will be provided with a registration number, a login id and password for the applicants to fill up essential details on the aforementioned website of the RERA. Real estate agents who facilitate selling or purchase of properties must take prior registration from RERA. Such agents will be issued a single registration number for each State or Union Territory, which must be quoted by the agent in every sale facilitated.

				 Dadra and Nagar Haveli is a union territory in Western India. It is composed of two separate geographical entities: Nagar Haveli, wedged between Maharashtra andGujarat, and, 1 km to the northwest, the smaller enclave of Dadra, which is surrounded by Gujarat. The capital city is Silvassa.The Union Territory comprises two separate geographical units. The larger part - Nagar Haveli - spans a roughly c-shaped area upriver from the city of Daman on the coast, at the centre of which, straddling the border with Gujarat, is the Madhuban reservoir. The smaller enclave of Dadra is a short distance to the northwest.<br>
</p>
<p>

Dadra and Nagar Haveli is in the middle of the undulating watershed of the Daman Ganga River, which flows through Nagar Haveli and later forms the short southern border of Dadra. The towns of Dadra and Silvassa lie on the north bank of the river. The Western Ghats range rises to the east, and the foothills of the range occupy the eastern portion of the district. It ranks 4th in area among the Union Territories and 32nd including the states. It is surrounded by Valsad District of Gujarat on the West, North, and East, and by Thane District of Maharashtra on the South and South-East (after the division of Thane District, it is now surrounded by newly formed Palghar District.). Maghval is a small enclave village belonging to Gujarat that is located within Nagar Haveli, just south of Silvassa. The nearest railway station is Vapi in Gujarat on the Mumbai-Delhi route, about 18 km northwest of Silvassa. Bombay is approximately 180 km from Silvassa. Surat city is about 140 km away.
